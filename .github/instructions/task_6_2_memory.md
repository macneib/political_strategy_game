- **Effort Estimate**: 6 days
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSING, DEMO WORKING

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Step 1: Context7 research on technology tree systems and advisor lobbying mechanics
- [x] Step 2: Analyze existing technology system and identify integration points
- [x] Step 3: Design political technology categories and prerequisite structure
- [x] Step 4: Implement core technology tree system with prerequisites
- [x] Step 5: Create advisor lobbying and preference system
- [x] Step 6: Integrate technology effects with existing systems (especially espionage)
- [x] Step 7: Build comprehensive testing suite
- [x] Step 8: Run tests and validate implementation
- [x] Step 9: Create demonstration system
- [x] Step 10: Balance and optimize technology progression

## Task Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All implementation goals have been successfully achieved:
- Core technology tree with 23+ political technologies across 5 categories
- Comprehensive advisor lobbying system with role-based preferences
- Coalition building and political pressure mechanics
- Full integration with existing resource management and espionage systems
- Complete test suite with 100% pass rate for core functionality
- Working demonstration showcasing all features

## Key Requirements from Task Specification
- Political technology definitions and effects
- Advisor lobbying for preferred research directions  
- Technology impact on political mechanics
- Research prerequisite system for political advances
- Technology tree balancing and progression testing

## Implementation Notes
- Build upon existing resource/technology system in src/core/resources.py
- Enhance espionage system with technology-unlocked capabilities
- Integrate with advisor system for lobbying mechanics
- Ensure seamless integration with all existing systems

## Context7 Research Findings

### Technology Tree Design Patterns (From GameStudies Research)
- **Three Design Structures**: Linear upgrade paths vs interlocking vine structures vs hybrid models
- **Technological Determinism**: Fixed sequences can be balanced with "or-ports" and alternative paths
- **Effect Attribution**: Technologies can have multiple effects (quantitative bonuses, unlocking capabilities, social changes)
- **Historical vs Gameplay Balance**: Selection priority = historical importance + gameplay function

### Key Design Insights (From Eclipse Board Game)
- **Dynamic vs Fixed Trees**: Variable tech availability increases replayability and strategic adaptation
- **Prerequisite Systems**: Discount systems reward specialization while maintaining accessibility
- **Pricing Models**: Dual pricing (normal/minimum) allows progressive discounts while preventing technology skipping
- **Technology Categories**: Separate tracks (Military/Economic/Social) with cross-track interactions

### Political Strategy Game Patterns
- **Social Technologies**: Include governance, policies, institutions alongside mechanical technologies
- **Advisor Integration**: Technologies should unlock advisor capabilities and influence decision-making
- **Civilization Characterization**: Tech trees can define civilization strengths/weaknesses
- **Progress Narrative**: Technology progression provides story arc and sense of advancement

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Existing System Analysis
- **Current Technology System**: Basic research with linear progression in src/core/resources.py
- **Technology Categories**: Military, Economic, Political tech levels with simple effects
- **Research Mechanics**: Point accumulation, queue system, predefined costs
- **Integration Points**: ResourceManager, TechnologyState, Civilization class

### Design Decisions for Enhancement
- **Technology Tree Structure**: Hybrid vine/branch system with OR-gates and prerequisites
- **Political Technology Categories**: 
  - Governance Systems (Democracy, Autocracy, Federation)
  - Information Control (Propaganda, Censorship, Media)
  - Administrative Technologies (Bureaucracy, Record-keeping, Census)
  - Social Engineering (Education, Healthcare, Infrastructure)
  - Intelligence Technologies (Espionage, Surveillance, Counter-intelligence)
- **Advisor Lobbying System**: Role-based preferences, influence-weighted prioritization
- **Integration Strategy**: Extend existing ResourceManager, enhance advisor system
