# Task 4.2 Memory

## Task Overview
**Task 4.2: Advanced LLM Features & Multi-Advisor Dynamics**
- Building on Task 4.1's LLM integration to create sophisticated AI-driven political dynamics
- Focus: Multi-advisor dialogues, conspiracy generation, dynamic storytelling, emotional modeling

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Current System Analysis [COMPLETE]
- ✅ Analyzed existing LLM advisor system architecture
- ✅ Identified enhancement opportunities for multi-advisor interactions
- ✅ Reviewed current AdvisorAI and AdvisorCouncil implementations
- ✅ Researched AutoGen multi-agent conversation patterns and architecture
- ✅ Identified integration points for advisor-to-advisor dialogue

### Step 2: Context7 Research [COMPLETE]  
- ✅ Researched multi-agent AI conversation systems and dialogue management
- ✅ Studied AutoGen framework patterns for conversable agents
- ✅ Analyzed dynamic conversation patterns and speaker selection
- ✅ Reviewed emotional modeling and personality consistency approaches
- ✅ Documented best practices for multi-turn conversation management

### Step 3: Multi-Advisor Dialogue System Architecture [COMPLETE]
- ✅ Designed multi-advisor dialogue system architecture based on AutoGen patterns
- ✅ Created DialogueContext, DialogueSession, and DialogueTurn data structures
- ✅ Implemented DialogueType enum for different conversation scenarios
- ✅ Built conversation management with turn-based speaker selection
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging and session tracking

### Step 4: Advisor-to-Advisor Conversation Mechanics [COMPLETE]
- ✅ Implemented MultiAdvisorDialogue class with council meeting support
- ✅ Added private conversation capabilities between advisor pairs
- ✅ Created dialogue prompt generation with personality and context integration
- ✅ Built conversation history tracking and turn management
- ✅ Added automatic dialogue completion and outcome processing

### Step 5: Emotional State Modeling [COMPLETE]
- ✅ Implemented AdvisorEmotionalModel with emotion tracking and intensity
- ✅ Created EmotionalState enum with 8 distinct emotional states
- ✅ Added emotional contagion mechanics between advisors
- ✅ Built emotion-based behavioral modifiers for response generation
- ✅ Implemented emotional tone analysis from advisor responses

### Step 6: Testing Infrastructure [COMPLETE]
- ✅ Created comprehensive test_dialogue.py (400+ lines) with 20+ test methods
- ✅ Implemented tests for emotional modeling and state transitions
- ✅ Added dialogue session management and conversation history tests
- ✅ Created integration tests for advisor council compatibility
- ✅ Built comprehensive test coverage for all dialogue system features

### Step 7: LLM-Generated Conspiracy Plot System [COMPLETE]
- ✅ Implemented ConspiracyGenerator class (600+ lines) with sophisticated AI-driven conspiracy creation
- ✅ Created ConspiracyType, ConspiracyStatus, ConspiracyMotive, ConspiracyParticipant data structures
- ✅ Added conspiracy condition analysis using LLM insights and political state assessment
- ✅ Built conspiracy motive generation based on advisor personalities and emotional triggers
- ✅ Implemented complete conspiracy plot generation with timeline, resources, and success conditions
- ✅ Added recruitment mechanics with AI-driven suitability assessment and target evaluation
- ✅ Created conspiracy progression system through planning, recruiting, preparation, and execution phases
- ✅ Built discovery risk calculation and conspiracy outcome determination
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive test_conspiracy.py (400+ lines) with 19 test methods covering all features
