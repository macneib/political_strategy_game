- Historical trend analysis displays

### Step 4: Political Status Dashboard (Day 4-5)
- Coup probability meters and threat indicators
- Faction strength comparison charts
- Political stability monitoring
- Crisis alert system with severity levels
- Key metrics overview dashboard

### Step 5: Memory System Browser (Day 5-6)
- Searchable advisor memory interface
- Memory relevance and reliability scoring
- Historical decision context display
- Memory connection mapping
- Memory trend analysis tools

### Step 6: Interactive Decision Interface (Day 6-7)
- Political decision option presentation
- Consequence prediction visualization
- Advisor recommendation displays
- Decision impact simulation
- Historical decision outcome tracking

### Step 7: Integration and Polish (Day 7-8)
- Cross-component data consistency
- Performance optimization for real-time updates
- Export/import functionality for analysis
- Integration with Game Engine Bridge
- Comprehensive testing and validation
