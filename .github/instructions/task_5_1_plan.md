# Task 5.1: Game Engine Bridge - Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
**Task 5.1: Game Engine Bridge** (5 days)
- Create communication layer between political engine and game engine (Unity/Godot)
- API bridge for game engine communication
- Turn synchronization between political and game systems
- Game state serialization for political engine consumption
- Event notification system for political changes
- Performance profiling for turn processing times

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Game Engine Bridge Architecture Design
- Design API communication protocol (JSON-based)
- Define message types and data structures
- Plan asynchronous communication patterns
- Create error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Step 2: Core Bridge Communication System
- Implement GameEngineBridge class
- Create message serialization/deserialization
- Build WebSocket or HTTP API endpoint
- Add connection management and health monitoring

### Step 3: Turn Synchronization System
- Implement TurnSynchronizer class
- Create turn state management
- Build turn progression coordination
- Add turn rollback and recovery mechanisms

### Step 4: Game State Serialization
- Create GameStateSerializer class
- Implement political state export/import
- Build incremental state updates
- Add state validation and integrity checks

### Step 5: Event Notification System
- Implement PoliticalEventBroadcaster class
- Create real-time event streaming
- Build event filtering and subscription system
- Add event replay and history tracking

### Step 6: Performance Profiling and Monitoring
- Create PerformanceProfiler class
- Implement turn processing time tracking
- Build performance metrics collection
- Add optimization recommendations

### Step 7: Integration Testing and Demo
- Create comprehensive integration tests
- Build demo game engine client
- Test all communication scenarios
- Performance benchmarking

## Technical Architecture

### Communication Protocol
- **Transport**: WebSocket for real-time, HTTP for batch operations
- **Format**: JSON for cross-language compatibility
- **Security**: Optional JWT tokens for authentication
- **Versioning**: API version headers for compatibility

### Message Types
1. **Game State Messages**: Full state sync, incremental updates
2. **Event Messages**: Political events, advisor actions, crises
3. **Command Messages**: Player decisions, advisor appointments
4. **System Messages**: Turn progression, health checks, errors

### Performance Requirements
- **Turn Processing**: < 500ms for standard turn
- **Event Latency**: < 100ms for real-time events
- **State Sync**: < 2s for full state serialization
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for bridge components

## Implementation Priority
1. Core bridge communication (Day 1-2)
2. Turn synchronization (Day 2-3)
3. State serialization (Day 3-4)
4. Event notification (Day 4)
5. Performance monitoring (Day 5)
6. Testing and demo (Day 5)

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Bi-directional communication established
- ✅ Turn synchronization working smoothly
- ✅ Complete state serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Real-time event streaming operational
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Demo client successfully interfacing
