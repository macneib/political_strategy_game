# Task 7.1: Performance Optimization - Progress Memory

## Task Overview
**Task 7.1: Performance Optimization**
- **Effort**: 5 days
- **Priority**: Medium  
- **Dependencies**: All core systems (COMPLETE)
- **Status**: COMPLETE - 13 August 2025

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Memory usage optimization for long-running games
- [x] LLM query batching and caching optimization  
- [x] Database query optimization for memory system
- [x] Concurrent processing for multiple civilizations
- [x] Performance benchmarking and regression testing

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Memory Profiling Phase**: Analyze current memory patterns and identify optimization opportunities
2. **LLM Optimization Phase**: Implement intelligent caching and query batching for AI interactions
3. **Database Optimization Phase**: Optimize JSON persistence and memory system queries
4. **Concurrency Phase**: Implement parallel processing for independent civilization operations
5. **Benchmarking Phase**: Create comprehensive performance testing and regression detection

## Key Performance Targets
- Memory usage: Stable memory usage for 8+ hour gameplay sessions
- LLM efficiency: 50%+ reduction in redundant AI queries through caching
- Database performance: Sub-100ms response times for memory operations
- Concurrency: Process 4+ civilizations simultaneously without blocking
- Benchmarks: Automated performance regression detection with 5% tolerance

## Project Context
- Current State: Feature-complete political strategy engine with 162+ tests
- Architecture: Python 3.11+, Pydantic v2, JSON persistence, comprehensive AI systems
- Foundation: All core systems complete, security hardened, CI/CD operational
- Ready for: Production-level performance optimization and scaling
