## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each system should be independently testable
2. **Scalability**: Design for complexity growth and feature expansion
3. **AI-First**: LLM integration as core architectural consideration
4. **Testability**: All functionality must be comprehensively tested

### Key Systems
- **Advisor System**: AI personalities with memory and relationships
- **Political Engine**: Decision-making with reputation tracking
- **Interactive Layer**: Real-time gameplay with player intervention
- **Memory Management**: Persistent state with emotional weighting
- **LLM Integration**: Context-aware conversations and decision support

---

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### Test Coverage Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation (core systems)
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-system interaction validation
- **Interactive Tests**: Real-time gameplay scenario validation
- **AI Tests**: LLM response quality and context management

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- New features require corresponding tests
- Performance benchmarks for AI operations
- Memory usage validation for long-running simulations

### Running Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Core functionality
uv run python tests/test_core_structures.py

# Advanced political features
uv run python tests/test_conspiracy_comprehensive.py
uv run python tests/test_diplomatic_negotiations.py

# Interactive gameplay
uv run python tests/interactive/test_real_time_council.py

# LLM integration validation
uv run python validation/validate_ai_dynamics_enhanced.py
```
