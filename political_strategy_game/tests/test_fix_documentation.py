Test Fix Documentation: Espionage Asset Assignment Determinism

This file documents the fix for the intermittent test failure in 
tests/test_espionage.py::TestEspionageManager::test_assign_assets_to_operation

ISSUE ANALYSIS:
- Test was failing randomly (~4% of the time) in GitHub Actions
- Root cause: Random skill levels for recruited assets sometimes fell below operation requirements
- ADVISOR_SURVEILLANCE operations require 0.5 skill level (MODERATE difficulty)
- Assignment check requires max_skill >= required_skill * 0.8 = 0.4
- Assets recruited with random skills between 0.3-0.8 sometimes both < 0.4

SOLUTION:
- Added deterministic random seed (42) for consistent test behavior
- Added fallback skill adjustment to ensure test requirements are met
- Maintains realistic testing while ensuring reliability

VALIDATION:
- Test now passes consistently across multiple runs
- All 29 espionage tests continue to pass
- No impact on actual game mechanics (only test behavior)
