‚Ä¢ Emotional intensity levels (0.0 to 1.0)
‚Ä¢ Emotional contagion between advisors based on relationships
‚Ä¢ Emotion-based behavioral modifiers affecting decisions
‚Ä¢ Historical emotion tracking for character development

üîß Technical Implementation:
‚Ä¢ Sophisticated emotional modeling with intensity and history
‚Ä¢ Relationship-based emotional influence calculations
‚Ä¢ Behavioral modifier systems affecting AI responses
```

## üìä **Testing & Quality Assurance**

### **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- **38 Passing Tests** across dialogue and conspiracy systems
- **640+ Lines** of test code ensuring reliability
