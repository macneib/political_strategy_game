1. **DiplomacyManager** (`src/core/diplomacy.py`)
   - Central coordinator for all inter-civilization diplomatic activities
   - Global stability tracking based on conflicts and cooperation
   - Turn-based processing of diplomatic events and relationship updates
   - Comprehensive diplomatic summaries for individual civilizations

2. **CivilizationRelations**
   - Bilateral relationship tracking with multiple metrics (trust, trade dependency, cultural affinity)
   - Embassy establishment with ambassador assignments
   - Historical tracking of diplomatic events and relationship changes
   - Active treaty, trade route, conflict, and intelligence network references

3. **Treaty System**
   - Multiple treaty types: Trade agreements, defense pacts, non-aggression pacts, cultural exchange
   - Comprehensive terms including trade values, military support levels, shared intelligence
   - Violation tracking and treaty status management
   - Auto-renewal and duration management

4. **Trade Route Management**
   - International trade connections with economic impact
   - Trade efficiency modifiers based on diplomatic relations
   - Disruption mechanics (piracy, conflicts, embargos)
   - Resource-specific trade (materials, food, luxury goods)

5. **Military Conflict System**
   - Multiple conflict types: Border skirmishes, trade wars, territorial disputes, full-scale wars
   - War exhaustion and civilian support mechanics
   - Military balance calculations and victor determination
   - Peace negotiation and resolution frameworks

6. **Intelligence Networks**
   - Spy network establishment and strength progression
   - Multiple operation types with success probability based on network strength
   - Counter-intelligence resistance and asset compromise mechanics
   - Intelligence gathering affecting diplomatic knowledge and decisions

### Integration Features:

1. **Civilization Class Enhancement**
   - Added 13 new diplomatic methods for comprehensive international relations
   - Integrated diplomatic memory creation for all diplomatic actions
   - Resource system integration for trade routes and conflict costs
   - Political state integration for war declaration and diplomatic successes

2. **Memory System Integration**
   - Diplomatic actions create appropriate advisor memories with role-specific emotional impact
   - Embassy establishment, treaty proposals, war declarations, trade agreements, and intelligence operations all generate advisor memories
   - Memory content includes specific details of diplomatic actions and their implications
   - Emotional impact varies based on advisor role (diplomatic advisors more affected by diplomatic events)

3. **Resource System Integration**
   - Trade routes provide ongoing economic benefits to both civilizations
   - Military conflicts drain treasury resources and affect military effectiveness
   - Intelligence operations consume espionage budgets
   - Economic stability affects diplomatic relationship quality

## ðŸŽ® **Demonstrated Capabilities**

### Multi-Civilization Scenario Features:
- **Embassy Network**: 4 civilizations with strategic embassy placements
- **Trade Networks**: Complex trade relationships generating economic benefits
- **Treaty Negotiations**: Multiple treaty types proposed and managed
- **Intelligence Operations**: Comprehensive espionage activities between all civilizations
- **Military Conflicts**: War declaration with objectives and ongoing conflict management
- **Memory Integration**: All diplomatic actions creating appropriate advisor memories

### Advanced Diplomatic Mechanics:
- **Global Stability Tracking**: System-wide stability calculation based on cooperation vs. conflict
- **Relationship Evolution**: Trust levels and trade dependency changing based on interactions
- **Economic Integration**: Trade routes affecting civilization treasuries and economic growth
- **Political Consequences**: Wars affecting internal political stability
- **Intelligence Networks**: Spy capabilities building up over time with counter-intelligence challenges

## ðŸ“ˆ **Technical Metrics**

- **New Tests**: 30 comprehensive diplomacy tests covering all aspects of inter-civilization systems
- **Total Test Suite**: 132 tests (102 existing + 30 new diplomacy tests, all passing)
- **New Classes**: 8 major diplomatic classes (DiplomacyManager, CivilizationRelations, Treaty, TradeRoute, MilitaryConflict, IntelligenceNetwork, DiplomaticEvent, plus 6 enums)
- **Integration Points**: Diplomatic system fully integrated with Political, Memory, Event, Resource, and Advisor systems
- **Demonstration Features**: Comprehensive 4-civilization diplomatic scenario showing all capabilities

## ðŸ”§ **Key Technical Achievements**

1. **Seamless Multi-System Integration**: Diplomatic system integrates without disrupting existing political, resource, or memory systems
2. **Advanced Relationship Modeling**: Multiple relationship metrics providing realistic diplomatic complexity
3. **Economic-Political Integration**: Trade routes affecting economics, conflicts affecting politics
4. **Memory-Driven Diplomacy**: All diplomatic actions create persistent advisor memories with appropriate emotional impact
5. **Scalable Architecture**: System designed to handle multiple civilizations with complex inter-relationships
6. **Turn-Based Coordination**: Diplomatic turns coordinate seamlessly with civilization turn processing
7. **Global State Management**: System-wide stability and cooperation metrics providing strategic overview
