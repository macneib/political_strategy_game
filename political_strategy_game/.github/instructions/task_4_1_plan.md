# Unified LLM interface supporting both local and remote
class LLMProvider:
    def generate_advisor_response(self, advisor, context, prompt) -> str
    
class VLLMProvider(LLMProvider):  # Local models
class OpenAIProvider(LLLProvider):  # GPT-4, etc.
class ClaudeProvider(LLMProvider):  # Claude 3.5, etc.
```

### Advisor AI Integration:
