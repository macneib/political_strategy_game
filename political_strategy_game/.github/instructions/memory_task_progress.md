# Main Branch Fix Task Progress

## Task: Fix Main Branch Merge Issues
**Objective**: Resolve cache file conflicts preventing git pull from main branch

## Current Status
- User attempted `git pull origin main` and encountered cache file conflicts
- Need to clean up untracked cache files that would be overwritten
- Then successfully merge main branch changes

## Todo List
```markdown
- [ ] Check current git status and branch
- [ ] Remove conflicting cache files
- [ ] Verify .gitignore is present on current branch  
- [ ] Attempt git pull from main branch
- [ ] Resolve any remaining merge conflicts
- [ ] Verify repository is in clean state
- [ ] Update memory with resolution
```

## Implementation Notes
- Cache files can be safely deleted as they're auto-generated
- Need to ensure .gitignore prevents future cache file tracking
- Main branch may have different .gitignore or project structure
