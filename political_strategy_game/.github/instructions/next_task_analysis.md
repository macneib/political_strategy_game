# Task Analysis: Next Implementation Priority

## âœ… Current Status
- **Task 2.2: Civilization Management System Integration** - **COMPLETED**
- All 79 tests passing
- Full system integration validated
- Comprehensive demonstration working

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Task Identified: Task 3.1 - Resource Management Systems**

### Task Overview
Based on the project documentation and logical progression, the next priority task is implementing **Resource Management Systems** that integrate with our existing civilization framework.

### Core Resource Systems to Implement:

1. **Economic System**
   - Civilization wealth and treasury management
   - Economic advisor influence on financial decisions
   - Economic events and consequences
   - Trade relationships between civilizations

2. **Military System**  
   - Military strength and unit management
   - Military advisor roles in defense/expansion
   - Military events (wars, conflicts, equipment needs)
   - Military technology and capabilities

3. **Technology System**
   - Research and development capabilities
   - Technology trees affecting political systems
   - Advisor lobbying for research directions
   - Technology-driven political advantages

### Integration Points:
- **Memory System**: Resources decisions create advisor memories
- **Event System**: Resource-based events (economic crisis, military threat, tech breakthrough)
- **Advisor System**: Resource-specific advisor roles and decision-making
- **Political System**: Resource levels affect political stability and advisor loyalty

### Expected Deliverables:
1. Core resource data models (Economy, Military, Technology)
2. Resource manager classes with update mechanics
3. Integration with existing civilization system
4. Resource-based events and consequences
5. Advisor decision-making based on resource levels
6. Comprehensive test suite for resource management
7. Demonstration script showing resource dynamics

### Estimated Effort:
- **5-7 days** based on complexity of integration with existing systems
- **High Priority** - Essential foundation for advanced political scenarios

## ðŸš€ Ready to Proceed
All prerequisites are met:
- âœ… Civilization system fully operational
- âœ… Event system integrated
- âœ… Memory system working
- âœ… Advisor system enhanced
- âœ… Testing framework established

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Task 3.1: Resource Management Systems** implementation.
