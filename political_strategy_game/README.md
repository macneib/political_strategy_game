## 🌟 What Makes This Revolutionary?

### Traditional Strategy Games:
- Build cities, research tech, raise armies
- Advisors are just stat bonuses
- Politics is a tech tree
- Internal threats are minimal

### **Our Revolutionary Approach:**
- **🧠 Advisors with Memory & Personality** - They remember every decision, form relationships, hold grudges
- **� AI-Powered Political Dynamics** - LLM integration creates emergent advisor personalities and conversations
- **🕵️ Information Warfare Systems** - Control narratives, plant false memories, detect conspiracy
- **💥 Real Coup Threats** - Your military advisor might stage a revolt if you ignore them
- **🎮 Interactive Political Gameplay** - Real-time council meetings, diplomatic negotiations, crisis management
- **📊 Advanced Decision Tracking** - Every choice builds your reputation and affects future advisor behavior

### The Result?
**The most sophisticated political simulation ever created** - where your greatest threats come from within your own government.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This game explores themes of:
- **Leadership under pressure** - Making decisions with incomplete information
- **Truth vs control** - The tension between transparency and authority  
- **Memory vs manipulation** - How information shapes political reality
- **Emergent narrative** - Stories that arise from AI personality interactions

The goal is creating a game where the most interesting dynamics happen *within* each civilization, not just between them.
