## 🌟 The Big Idea

Traditional 4X games focus on expansion, exploration, exploitation, and extermination. We're adding a fifth X: **eXistential dread** from your own government.

### What Makes This Different?

Instead of just managing resources and armies, you're managing a **living political ecosystem** where:

- 🧠 **Advisors have memory and personality** - They remember every slight, every favor, every broken promise
- 🤝 **Relationships evolve dynamically** - Trust can be built over decades and shattered in a moment  
- 🕵️ **Information is weaponized** - What your advisors know (or think they know) shapes everything
- 💥 **Internal coups are always possible** - Your greatest threat might be sitting at your council table
- 🤖 **AI personalities emerge naturally** - Through LLM integration, advisors develop unique voices and agendas

### The Vision

Imagine a strategy game where:
- Your military advisor stages a coup because you ignored their advice one too many times
- Economic advisors form secret alliances to push policies that benefit their hidden investments
- Religious advisors manipulate information to justify wars that serve their theological agenda
- Your spymaster feeds you false intelligence because a rival civilization bribed them years ago

**This isn't just a game - it's a sandbox for exploring power, trust, and the psychology of leadership.**
