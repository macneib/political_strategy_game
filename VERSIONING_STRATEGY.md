# Semantic Versioning Strategy for Political Strategy Game

## Current Version: 0.8.0

We're implementing semantic versioning to track our progress toward the 1.0.0 release and beyond.

## Version Strategy

## Semantic Versioning Rules

### MAJOR version (X.0.0)
- Incompatible API changes
- Major architectural redesigns
- Breaking changes to save game format
- New game engine requirements

### MINOR version (0.X.0)
- New features and capabilities
- New advisor types or political systems
- Additional LLM integrations
- Game engine enhancements
- Backward compatible changes

### PATCH version (0.0.X)
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Security patches
- Documentation updates
- Test improvements

## Release Automation

### Conventional Commits
We use conventional commit messages to automatically determine version bumps:

```bash
feat: add new conspiracy detection algorithm     # MINOR bump
fix: resolve memory leak in advisor processing   # PATCH bump
feat!: redesign political event system          # MAJOR bump
```

### Automated Release Process
1. **CI/CD Validation** - All 391 tests must pass
2. **Commit Analysis** - Semantic release analyzes commit history
3. **Version Calculation** - Determines next version based on changes
4. **Changelog Generation** - Automatically updates CHANGELOG.md
5. **Release Creation** - GitHub release with generated notes
6. **Asset Upload** - Documentation, demos, and completion reports

### Quality Gates
Before any release:
- âœ… All tests passing (391/391)
- âœ… Performance benchmarks met
- âœ… Security scans clean
- âœ… Demo functionality validated
- âœ… Documentation updated

## Development Milestones

### Current Status (v0.8.0)
**Progress**: 75% toward 1.0.0
**Quality**: Production-ready core systems
**Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (391 tests)
**Architecture**: Scalable, modular design

### Key Achievements
- **Revolutionary AI Development**: Proven AI-first development methodology
- **Complex System Integration**: Multiple sophisticated systems working seamlessly
- **Production Quality**: Enterprise-grade error handling and validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: More thorough testing than most commercial games

### Next Milestones
1. **v0.9.0** - LLM Integration (Est. 2-3 weeks)
2. **v1.0.0** - Production Release (Est. 1-2 months)
3. **v1.1.0** - Enhanced Features (Est. 3-4 months)

## Release Communication

### Release Notes Format
