### 🧬 Key Technical Innovations

#### Learning Rate Algorithm
```python
final_rate = base_rate * era_modifier * age_effect * trait_effect * 
             synergy_bonus * development_type_modifier * mentorship_bonus
```

#### Breakthrough System
- Plateau threshold: 0.75 for most skills
- Breakthrough probability: 5% base chance
- 2x learning rate boost when breakthrough occurs

#### Achievement Difficulty Distribution
- **Common**: 40-80% unlock rate (Emerging Leader)
- **Uncommon**: 15-40% unlock rate (Master Craftsman)
- **Rare**: 5-15% unlock rate (Strategic Mastermind)
- **Legendary**: 1-5% unlock rate (Renaissance Polymath)
- **Mythic**: <1% unlock rate (Immortal Legacy)
