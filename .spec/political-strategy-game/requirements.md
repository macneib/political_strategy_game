# Requirements Specification: Political Strategy Game (PROJECT_NAME)

## Overview
A turn-based 4X strategy game that combines traditional civilization-building mechanics with deep AI-driven internal political dynamics. Each AI civilization is governed by a leader and advisors with distinct personalities, memories, and motives, creating emergent political drama through trust, betrayal, and manipulation.

**Core Innovation**: Internal political simulation where advisors have agency, memory, and personal agendas that can conflict with their civilization's objectives.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Basic Turn Management
**As a** player
**I want** to execute standard 4X turn actions (city development, research, diplomacy, military)
**So that** I can build and expand my civilization

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a player begins their turn
THE SYSTEM SHALL present available actions for cities, units, research, and diplomacy

WHEN a player completes all desired actions
THE SYSTEM SHALL advance to the next civilization's turn

WHEN all civilizations complete their turns
THE SYSTEM SHALL advance to the next game turn and update all systems

### Story 2: AI Civilization Internal Politics
**As a** game system
**I want** AI civilizations to have internal political dynamics between leaders and advisors
**So that** each AI civilization exhibits realistic political behavior and decision-making

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN an AI civilization's turn begins
THE SYSTEM SHALL simulate internal advisor discussions based on current game state

WHEN advisors evaluate past decisions
THE SYSTEM SHALL update their memory, relationships, and trust levels

WHEN a leader makes decisions that contradict advisor recommendations
THE SYSTEM SHALL modify advisor loyalty and influence accordingly

### Story 3: Advisor Personality System
**As a** game system
**I want** each advisor to have distinct personality traits, goals, and relationships
**So that** internal politics feel authentic and create diverse emergent behaviors

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN an advisor is created
THE SYSTEM SHALL assign personality traits (ambition, loyalty, greed, ideology, etc.)

WHEN an advisor interacts with events or other advisors
THE SYSTEM SHALL modify relationships and influence based on personality compatibility

WHEN an advisor's goals conflict with current civilization direction
THE SYSTEM SHALL generate appropriate political responses (opposition, conspiracy, betrayal)

### Story 4: Memory and Information System
**As a** game system
**I want** advisors to maintain historical memory that can decay, be manipulated, or selectively shared
**So that** information asymmetry creates realistic political tension

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN significant events occur
THE SYSTEM SHALL record them in advisor memories with varying levels of detail and accuracy

WHEN time passes without reinforcement
THE SYSTEM SHALL gradually decay non-critical memories

WHEN leaders choose to withhold or manipulate information
THE SYSTEM SHALL create knowledge gaps that affect advisor decision-making

WHEN new advisors are appointed
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide limited historical context, creating fresh perspectives

### Story 5: Internal Coup Mechanics
**As a** game system
**I want** advisors to be able to overthrow leaders through political maneuvering
**So that** AI civilizations can experience dramatic leadership changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN advisor loyalty falls below critical thresholds
THE SYSTEM SHALL enable conspiracy formation between advisors

WHEN conspirators reach sufficient combined influence
THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger coup attempt with success probability based on faction strength

WHEN a coup succeeds
THE SYSTEM SHALL replace the leader and potentially purge opposing advisors

WHEN a coup fails
THE SYSTEM SHALL punish conspirators and increase security measures

### Story 6: Technology and Governance Research
**As a** player or AI
**I want** to research technologies that affect political systems and information control
**So that** technological advancement influences internal political dynamics

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN researching governance technologies
THE SYSTEM SHALL unlock new political mechanics (propaganda, surveillance, distributed power)

WHEN researching memory technologies
THE SYSTEM SHALL improve advisor information retention and transfer capabilities

WHEN advisors have personal interests in specific technologies
THE SYSTEM SHALL influence civilization research priorities through advisor lobbying

### Story 7: LLM-Driven Advisor Simulation
**As a** game system
**I want** to use LLM integration to simulate realistic advisor personalities and decision-making
**So that** each advisor feels like a unique character with coherent motivations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN an advisor needs to make a decision or give advice
THE SYSTEM SHALL query the LLM with the advisor's personality, memory, and current context

WHEN advisors interact with each other
THE SYSTEM SHALL use LLM responses to generate realistic dialogue and relationship changes

WHEN leaders need to respond to advisor input
THE SYSTEM SHALL use LLM to generate leader responses based on their personality and objectives

### Story 8: Player Intelligence Operations
**As a** player
**I want** to conduct espionage and psychological operations against enemy civilizations
**So that** I can exploit their internal political weaknesses

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN a player has sufficient espionage capabilities
THE SYSTEM SHALL allow monitoring of enemy advisor communications and relationships

WHEN a player conducts disinformation campaigns
THE SYSTEM SHALL introduce false memories or manipulated information into enemy advisor systems

WHEN a player bribes or blackmails enemy advisors
THE SYSTEM SHALL modify target advisor loyalty and behavior patterns

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
WHEN the game processes AI civilization turns
THE SYSTEM SHALL complete all internal political simulations within 30 seconds per civilization

WHEN LLM integration is used for advisor simulation
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain response times under 5 seconds for critical game flow decisions

### Scalability Requirements
WHEN the game supports multiple AI civilizations
THE SYSTEM SHALL handle up to 8 civilizations with 6-10 advisors each without performance degradation

### Memory Requirements
WHEN advisors accumulate historical memories over long games
THE SYSTEM SHALL implement efficient memory storage and retrieval to prevent excessive resource usage

### Reliability Requirements
WHEN LLM services are unavailable
THE SYSTEM SHALL fall back to rule-based advisor behavior to maintain game continuity

### Usability Requirements
WHEN players interact with the political system
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear visualization of advisor relationships, loyalties, and internal faction dynamics

WHEN AI civilizations experience internal political events
THE SYSTEM SHALL notify players of significant changes (coups, purges, policy shifts) through appropriate UI elements
