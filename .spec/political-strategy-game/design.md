# Design Specification: Political Strategy Game (PROJECT_NAME)

## Architecture Overview

The game follows a modular architecture separating the political simulation engine from the visual presentation layer. This allows for complex AI-driven political dynamics while maintaining flexibility for different frontend implementations.

### Core Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Political simulation, game rules, and presentation are independent modules
- **LLM Integration**: Advisor personalities and decision-making leverage Large Language Models for emergent behavior
- **Event-Driven Design**: Political events trigger cascading effects through the advisor network
- **Persistent Memory**: Long-term advisor memory system with decay and manipulation mechanics

## Data Model

### Core Entities

#### Advisor Entity
```yaml
Advisor:
  id: string (unique)
  name: string
  role: enum [military, economic, diplomatic, cultural, religious, security]
  personality:
    ambition: float (0.0-1.0)
    loyalty: float (0.0-1.0)
    ideology: string
    corruption: float (0.0-1.0)
    pragmatism: float (0.0-1.0)
  relationships:
    - advisor_id: string
      trust: float (-1.0-1.0)
      influence: float (0.0-1.0)
  memory: AdvisorMemory
  status: enum [active, dismissed, executed, retired]
```

#### Memory Entity
```yaml
Memory:
  id: string
  advisor_id: string
  event_type: string
  content: string
  emotional_impact: float
  reliability: float (0.0-1.0)
  decay_rate: float
  created_turn: integer
  last_accessed_turn: integer
  tags: List[string]
```

#### Political Event Entity
```yaml
PoliticalEvent:
  id: string
  type: enum [decision, crisis, conspiracy, coup, appointment]
  participants: List[string] (advisor_ids)
  context: Dict
  consequences: List[Consequence]
  turn_occurred: integer
```

### Relationships
- One Civilization has one Leader and multiple Advisors
- Advisors have many-to-many relationships with other Advisors
- Each Advisor has multiple Memories
- Political Events can involve multiple Advisors
- Memories reference Political Events

## API Specification

### Internal Python APIs

#### Political Engine API
```python
class PoliticalEngine:
    def process_turn(self, civilization_id: str) -> TurnResult
    def trigger_event(self, event: PoliticalEvent) -> EventResult
    def get_advisor_advice(self, advisor_id: str, decision_context: Dict) -> Advice
    def check_coup_conditions(self, civilization_id: str) -> CoupAssessment
```

#### Memory System API
```python
class MemoryManager:
    def store_memory(self, advisor_id: str, memory: Memory) -> bool
    def recall_memories(self, advisor_id: str, tags: List[str]) -> List[Memory]
    def decay_memories(self, advisor_id: str) -> int
    def transfer_memories(self, from_advisor: str, to_advisor: str, filter_tags: List[str]) -> bool
```

### Game Engine Integration API
```python
class GameIntegrationAPI:
    def get_civilization_state(self, civ_id: str) -> CivilizationState
    def notify_political_event(self, event: PoliticalEvent) -> None
    def request_leader_decision(self, decision_context: DecisionContext) -> Decision
```

## Security Considerations

### LLM Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All game data passed to LLMs must be sanitized to prevent prompt injection
- **Response Validation**: LLM responses are validated against expected formats and constraints
- **Fallback Systems**: Rule-based backup systems ensure game continuity if LLM services fail
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive LLM API usage

### Data Privacy
- **Local Storage**: Advisor memories and political data stored locally by default
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: Cloud saves are encrypted and user-controlled
- **Anonymization**: No personally identifiable information in game data

### Game Integrity
- **Deterministic Fallbacks**: When LLMs are unavailable, deterministic algorithms ensure consistent game behavior
- **State Validation**: Game state is validated after each political simulation cycle
- **Rollback Capability**: System can rollback to previous stable state if corruption detected

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Targets
- **Turn Processing**: Complete AI civilization turn in under 30 seconds
- **LLM Response Time**: Advisor LLM queries complete within 5 seconds
- **Memory Operations**: Memory retrieval and storage under 100ms
- **Political Simulation**: Full political cycle under 10 seconds per civilization

### Scalability Approach
- **Asynchronous Processing**: LLM queries and memory operations run asynchronously
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed advisor data cached in memory
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple advisor queries batched to LLM when possible
- **Progressive Loading**: Advisor memories loaded on-demand rather than all at once

### Resource Management
- **Memory Limits**: Implement memory caps for advisor historical data
- **LLM Quotas**: Track and limit LLM API usage per session
- **Background Processing**: Non-critical political updates processed during idle time

## Implementation Considerations

### Technology Stack
**Core Engine**: Python 3.11+ with asyncio for concurrent operations
**Data Storage**: JSON files for prototyping, SQLite for production
**LLM Integration**: OpenAI API initially, with adapter pattern for multiple providers
**Game Engine**: Unity (C#) or Godot (GDScript/C#) for presentation layer

### Development Phases
1. **Core Political Engine**: Basic advisor simulation without LLM
2. **Memory System**: Implement advisor memory with decay mechanics
3. **LLM Integration**: Add LLM-driven advisor personalities
4. **Political Events**: Coup mechanics and conspiracy systems
5. **Game Integration**: Connect to visual game engine
6. **Advanced Features**: Player espionage and psychological operations

### Integration Architecture
```python
# Game Engine (Unity/Godot) communicates via:
class GameBridge:
    def __init__(self, political_engine: PoliticalEngine):
        self.political_engine = political_engine
        self.message_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    
    async def process_turn(self, civ_data: Dict) -> Dict:
        result = await self.political_engine.process_turn(civ_data)
        return self.format_for_game_engine(result)
```

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality if components fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All political events and decisions logged for debugging
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery from corrupt advisor states
- **User Notifications**: Clear error messages when political system issues occur

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual advisor behavior and memory operations
- **Integration Tests**: Full political cycles with multiple advisors
- **LLM Mocking**: Mock LLM responses for consistent testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with maximum advisor counts
- **Political Scenarios**: Scripted political situations to verify correct behavior
