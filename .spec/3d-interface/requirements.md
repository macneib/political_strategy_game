# Requirements Specification: 3D Interactive Game Interface

## Overview
Create a visually immersive Godot-based 3D interface that transforms the Political Strategy Game into a playable strategy experience comparable to Civilization VI, Master of Orion II, or Terra Invicta. This interface bridges the sophisticated political simulation with modern strategy game visual quality and user experience.

**Strategic Vision**: Deliver "Alesia" as a premium 3D strategy game that uses visual storytelling and environmental design to communicate the complexity of political relationships and era progression through intuitive, beautiful interfaces.

## Era-Specific Visual Environments

### Visual Evolution Through Eras

2. **Classical Era**: Stone forums, marble columns, organized settlements, formal architecture
3. **Medieval Era**: Great halls, castles, Gothic architecture, ornate chambers
4. **Renaissance Era**: Palatial rooms, Renaissance art, sophisticated furniture, cultural refinement
5. **Industrial Era**: Government buildings, industrial architecture, mechanical elements
6. **Modern Era**: War rooms, modern architecture, electrical lighting, contemporary design
7. **Atomic Era**: Bunkers, secure facilities, Cold War aesthetics, utilitarian design
8. **Information Era**: Digital interfaces, high-tech environments, modern technology integration
9. **AI Era**: AI-assisted interfaces, holographic displays, futuristic design elements
10. **Machine AI Era**: Post-human environments, advanced AI interfaces, consciousness visualization
