# Requirements Specification: Core Game Architecture

## Overview
Establish the foundational 4X strategy game architecture that supports the Political Strategy Game's sophisticated simulation engine while providing the structural framework for era progression, save systems, and extensible game mechanics.

**Strategic Vision**: Create "Alesia" - a strategy game framework that supports progression through ten distinct eras (Ancient → Classical → Medieval → Renaissance → Industrial → Modern → Atomic → Information → AI → Machine AI) with extensible architecture for future feature additions.

## Era Progression System

### Era Sequence and Core Mechanics
1. **Ancient Era**: Basic tribal structures, simple resource management, oral traditions
2. **Classical Era**: Formal institutions, written records, basic diplomacy
3. **Medieval Era**: Feudal systems, religious influence, trade networks
4. **Renaissance Era**: Cultural flowering, exploration, early science
5. **Industrial Era**: Mass production, rapid communication, industrial warfare
6. **Modern Era**: Global systems, mass media, complex diplomacy
7. **Atomic Era**: Nuclear technology, Cold War dynamics, space exploration
8. **Information Era**: Digital systems, global communication, cyber capabilities
9. **AI Era**: AI-assisted systems, algorithmic governance, digital transformation
10. **Machine AI Era**: Post-human systems, technological singularity, AI consciousness

### Era Implementation Strategy
**IMPLEMENTATION DECISION POINT**: Implement Ancient → Classical → Medieval eras in Phase 2, with remaining eras as post-launch expansions.

**Rationale**: Starting with 3-4 basic eras allows us to:
- Establish core era transition mechanics
- Test progression systems with manageable complexity
- Validate gameplay balance and pacing
- Add remaining eras without architectural changes

## User Stories

### Story 1: Era Progression Framework
**As a** strategy game player
**I want** to advance my civilization through distinct technological and cultural eras
**So that** I can experience long-term civilization development with meaningful progression milestones

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN I research era-advancing technologies
THE SYSTEM SHALL unlock new era-specific buildings, units, and capabilities

WHEN my civilization transitions between eras
THE SYSTEM SHALL update available technologies, building types, and strategic options

WHEN I load a saved game from any era
THE SYSTEM SHALL restore the complete civilization state including era-specific features

### Story 2: Extensible Game Architecture
**As a** developer
**I want** a modular game architecture that supports future feature additions
**So that** new systems can be added without major architectural rewrites

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN new game systems are added
THE SYSTEM SHALL integrate through well-defined interfaces without breaking existing functionality

WHEN configuration changes are made
THE SYSTEM SHALL load new settings without requiring code changes

WHEN save game format evolves
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain backward compatibility with previous versions

### Story 3: Cross-Platform Foundation
**As a** strategy game player
**I want** consistent game performance across Windows, macOS, and Linux
**So that** I can play the game on my preferred platform with reliable performance

**Acceptance Criteria**:
WHEN running on any supported platform
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain 60+ FPS performance during normal gameplay

WHEN saving and loading games
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain compatibility across all supported platforms

WHEN using different hardware configurations
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide scalable graphics and performance options

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
WHEN managing large civilizations in later eras
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain responsive performance under 100ms for UI interactions

WHEN processing turn calculations
THE SYSTEM SHALL complete turn processing within 30 seconds for typical game states

### Platform Requirements
WHEN deploying the game
THE SYSTEM SHALL support native Windows 10+, macOS 12+, and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+) desktop applications

### Extensibility Requirements
WHEN adding new eras or features
THE SYSTEM SHALL support expansion through configuration files and modular architecture

WHEN integrating with external systems
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide well-defined APIs for game state access and modification

## Architectural Foundations

### Core Data Architecture
```python
class GameState:
    def __init__(self):
        # Core game progression
        self.current_era = EraType.ANCIENT
        self.turn_number = 0
        self.game_year = -4000  # Starting in Ancient era
        
        # Extensible system managers
        self.civilization_manager = CivilizationManager()
        self.technology_manager = TechnologyManager()
        self.map_manager = HexMapManager()
        
        # Cross-system integration points
        self.event_bus = GameEventBus()
        self.save_manager = SaveGameManager()
        
    def advance_era(self, new_era):
        """Framework for era transitions with system notifications"""
        self.event_bus.notify("era_transition_starting", new_era)
        self.current_era = new_era
        self.event_bus.notify("era_transition_complete", new_era)
```

### Era Configuration System
```json
{
  "ancient": {
    "display_name": "Ancient Era",
    "start_year": -4000,
    "end_year": -500,
    "technology_groups": ["stone_tools", "agriculture", "animal_husbandry"],
    "building_types": ["settlement", "granary", "barracks"],
    "unit_types": ["warrior", "settler", "worker"],
    "victory_conditions": ["conquest", "cultural"]
  },
  "classical": {
    "display_name": "Classical Era", 
    "start_year": -500,
    "end_year": 500,
    "technology_groups": ["iron_working", "philosophy", "engineering"],
    "building_types": ["library", "forum", "aqueduct"],
    "unit_types": ["legionary", "catapult", "galley"],
    "victory_conditions": ["conquest", "cultural", "diplomatic"]
  }
}
```

### Save System Architecture
```python
class SaveGameManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.version = "1.0.0"
        self.compression_enabled = True
        
    def save_game(self, game_state, filename):
        """Save complete game state with version compatibility"""
        save_data = {
            "version": self.version,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "game_state": game_state.serialize(),
            "era_data": game_state.current_era.serialize(),
            "system_states": self._serialize_all_systems(game_state)
        }
        
    def load_game(self, filename):
        """Load game with backward compatibility handling"""
        # Version migration and compatibility logic
        pass
```

### Cross-System Event Architecture
```python
class GameEventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subscribers = defaultdict(list)
        
    def subscribe(self, event_type, handler):
        """Allow systems to listen for game events"""
        self.subscribers[event_type].append(handler)
        
    def notify(self, event_type, data):
        """Broadcast events to all interested systems"""
        for handler in self.subscribers[event_type]:
            handler(data)
```
