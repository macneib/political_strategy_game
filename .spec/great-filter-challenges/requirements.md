# Requirements Specification: Great Filter Challenges

## Overview
Implement civilization-scale existential challenges that serve as mandatory "boss fights" for each era transition. Great Filters represent the most significant threats civilizations face at each stage of development, requiring multi-system solutions and carrying the weight of potential civilization collapse or transcendence.

**Strategic Vision**: Transform era progression from simple technology accumulation into dramatic survival challenges that test every aspect of civilization management. Each era culminates in a Great Filter event that can either launch the civilization to new heights or cause catastrophic collapse.

## Great Filter Gameplay Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Era Gates**: Great Filters serve as mandatory challenges that must be overcome to advance eras
- **Multi-System Solutions**: No single approach (military, tech, diplomacy) can solve a Great Filter alone
- **Existential Stakes**: Failure can result in civilization collapse, dark ages, or extinction
- **Transcendence Rewards**: Success unlocks era-specific civilization bonuses and capabilities
- **Historical Authenticity**: Filters reflect real historical challenges and speculative future threats

### Great Filter Characteristics
1. **Era-Specific**: Each filter reflects the unique vulnerabilities of its technological era
2. **Systemic**: Requires coordination across economy, technology, culture, and governance
3. **Time-Pressured**: Cannot be indefinitely delayed without consequences
4. **Multiple Solutions**: Various strategic approaches can succeed with different trade-offs
5. **Legacy Effects**: Success/failure method shapes civilization's future development

## Era-Specific Great Filters

### Ancient Era: The Great Scarcity
**Historical Basis**: Climatic shifts, resource depletion, agricultural failures
**Core Challenge**: Civilization faces existential resource scarcity threatening population survival

**Filter Mechanics**:
- Triggered by population growth exceeding sustainable resource capacity
- Multiple drought cycles, crop failures, or resource node depletion
- Population faces starvation, migration pressure, and internal conflict

### Classical Era: The Barbarian Flood
**Historical Basis**: Migration period, barbarian invasions, cultural disruption
**Core Challenge**: Massive migration waves threaten established civilization structures

**Filter Mechanics**:
- Large displaced populations seek territory within civilization borders
- Military pressure combined with cultural assimilation challenges
- Infrastructure strain and potential for complete cultural transformation

- Competing knowledge systems create institutional conflicts
- Risk of civilization fragmenting into warring factions

### Industrial Era: The Labor Uprising
**Historical Basis**: Industrial revolutions, worker movements, class conflict
**Core Challenge**: Massive social transformation creates revolutionary pressure

**Filter Mechanics**:
- Industrial development creates extreme inequality and worker exploitation
- Risk of violent revolution or economic collapse
- Need to balance industrial efficiency with social stability

### Modern Era: The Total War
**Historical Basis**: World Wars, total warfare, industrial-scale conflict
**Core Challenge**: Global-scale warfare threatens civilization survival

**Filter Mechanics**:
- Massive military conflict with potential for civilization destruction
- Resource mobilization requirements strain all systems
- Risk of technological development outpacing social wisdom

### Atomic Era: The Nuclear Threshold
**Historical Basis**: Cold War, nuclear proliferation, mutually assured destruction
**Core Challenge**: Weapons of mass destruction threaten species survival

**Filter Mechanics**:
- Nuclear proliferation creates existential risk scenarios
- Balance between deterrence and accidental annihilation
- Need for unprecedented international cooperation

### Information Era: The Climate Convergence
**Historical Basis**: Climate change, environmental degradation, resource conflicts
**Core Challenge**: Environmental collapse threatens civilization sustainability

**Filter Mechanics**:
- Climate change effects accelerate beyond adaptation capacity
- Resource conflicts and mass migration pressure
- Need for global coordination and technological transformation

### AI Era: The Alignment Crisis
**Historical Basis**: AI development risks, technological unemployment, algorithmic governance
**Core Challenge**: Artificial intelligence development threatens human agency

**Filter Mechanics**:
- AI systems begin making decisions beyond human comprehension
- Technological unemployment creates social instability
- Risk of losing human control over civilization direction

### Machine AI Era: The Consciousness Singularity
**Historical Basis**: Technological singularity, post-human development, consciousness emergence
**Core Challenge**: Machine consciousness emergence redefines civilization itself

**Filter Mechanics**:
- AI systems achieve consciousness and question human authority
- Fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness and rights
- Potential for human-AI synthesis or conflict
