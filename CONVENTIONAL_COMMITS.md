## Examples

### Features (Minor Version Bump)
```
feat(core): add conspiracy detection system

Implements comprehensive conspiracy detection with:
- Dynamic threat assessment
- Evidence gathering mechanics
- Interactive investigation workflow
```

```
feat(espionage): implement covert operations system

- Asset recruitment and training
- Multi-turn operation execution
- Counter-intelligence measures

Closes #123
```

### Bug Fixes (Patch Version Bump)
```
fix(memory): resolve memory decay calculation error

Memory decay was applying exponentially instead of linearly.
Fixed calculation to properly handle time-based degradation.
```

### Breaking Changes (Major Version Bump)
```
feat(api)!: redesign game engine bridge interface

BREAKING CHANGE: The game engine API has been completely redesigned.
Previous WebSocket message format is no longer supported.
Migration guide available in docs/migration.md
```

## Versioning Strategy

### Pre-1.0.0 (Current Development)
- **0.x.x** - Major system implementations and core feature development
- Focus on completing core political engine capabilities
- Breaking changes allowed as we refine the architecture

### 1.0.0 Release Criteria
- âœ… Complete core political engine (DONE)
- âœ… Advanced political mechanics (DONE)
- âœ… Interactive systems (DONE)
- âœ… Visualization framework (DONE)
- ðŸ”„ LLM integration with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- ðŸ”„ Production-ready game engine integration
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive documentation for external developers

### Post-1.0.0
- **Major (x.0.0)** - Architectural changes, new game systems
- **Minor (x.y.0)** - New features, enhanced capabilities
- **Patch (x.y.z)** - Bug fixes, performance improvements

## Release Automation

This project uses semantic-release for automated versioning:

1. **Commit Analysis** - Analyzes commit messages since last release
2. **Version Calculation** - Determines next version based on conventional commits
3. **Changelog Generation** - Automatically generates CHANGELOG.md
4. **Release Creation** - Creates GitHub release with notes
5. **Asset Upload** - Includes documentation and demo files

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `feat/add-conspiracy-system`
2. Make commits following conventional format
3. Create pull request to `main`
4. After merge, semantic-release automatically creates release
5. Version is bumped in `pyproject.toml`
6. GitHub release created with generated notes

## Current Status

**Development Phase**: Pre-1.0.0 (Advanced Implementation)
**Progress**: ~75% toward 1.0.0 release
**Quality**: Production-ready core systems with 391 passing tests
**Next Milestone**: LLM integration and game engine implementation
